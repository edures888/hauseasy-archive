## Introduction
This website allowed property selling users to post listings and buying users could request to start a transaction with them, which brought them to a interactive section called "Co-op" that guided both parties on each step of Singapore's property transaction process. 
This meant that they could indicate on the platform which steps were completed and the widgets were updated to show the following series of specific actions to tak, while being able to observe what the opposing party have done on their end.

The remaining static pages are still hosted [here](https://hauseasy.vercel.app).

After attempting to grow the business by connecting buyers and sellers, we took a break due to attend to personal matters, and [HDB came up with their own platform](https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing)
